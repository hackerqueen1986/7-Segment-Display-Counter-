How it works:
Run the project    
Run the Python script on your Raspberry Pi.
The 7-segment display should begin to count up, displaying each number from \(0\) to \(9\) sequentially. 
If it doesn't work, double-check your wiring, especially the GPIO pin connections and the placement of the resistors.
Check if you are using the correct segment map for a common cathode vs. common anode display.
